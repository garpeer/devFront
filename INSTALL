                                 devFront


- Copy the files to a folder (eg. /var/www/devfront/ , must be accessible by 
  the server)
- Move the index.php to the web root (usually /var/www/)
- Edit index.php, give the correct path for the 'require'
- If you installed the script in a folder other than 'devfront', pass the url 
  path to the constructor as a parameter (with trailing slash)
- Script folder must be writable to create the config.php file
- The first time the script is run, it adds the /var/www/ folder (if it exists)
  to its folder list.


                                 Example

Web root is /var/www/, script is in /var/www/foo/bar, content of index.php:

require('foo/bar/devfront.php');
new Devfront('/foo/bar/');
